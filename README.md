# Library Project
A simple app to register which book the user read, collect user info about the book and dispalay  them in a nice way.

Made for The Odin Project.

## Features

The Project asked for a simple application that collects via form informations about a book, stores them in an array of objects and then displays all the books in the UI.

I added a bit of styling and some extra feature:
- Statistics Panel: displays data about the total of books, amount/percentage of read books and toal pages read, so you can feel so smart!
- Mobile support! The app is completely functional (and I dare to say looks good) on mobile also.
